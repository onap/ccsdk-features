Mediator
========

Some device vendors (Altiostar, CommScope, Dragonwave-X) use the
`generic mediator
framework <https://github.com/Melacon/NetConf2SNMP>`__. Such mediators
offer an API to create, delete, start and stop mediator instances.

New mediator servers can be added via the '+' button. Afterward, a
server can be selected to view all available mediator instances.

A mediator instance can be started, stopped and deleted using the
available actions. Additionally, its details can be viewed. The '+'
button allows the user to add a new instance. During the creation, at
least one 'ODL auto connect' configuration must be added.
