# Performance Monitoring

Performance Monitoring values measured by the devices are necessary to analyze and optimize the network. Therefore the application automatically retrieves all historical performance values from the devices and stores them in a data base. The client part just retrieves the values from the database and displays them in graphical and/or grid views.

## Current performance values

After selection of a connected PNF supporting ONF-TR-532 and an physical interface, the application collects the current performance values directly from the device and displays then in table views. 

## Performance history values

After selection of a connected PNF supporting ONF-TR-532 and an physical interface, the application collects the received and centralized stored performance values for this interface and displays then in table views. 

## Performance link values

After selection of two air-interface creating an air-interface-link, the application collects the received and centralized stored performance values for this link and displays the data in diagrams and table views.
