# Maintenance Mode

The 'Maintenance' application on the OpenDaylight provides the information of the Network Elements which are set for Maintenance, currently or in the future.

When a Network Element is mounted with the maintenance mode it automatically shows on this application with the Information like when maintenance will be started or ended.

Maintenance Mode field in this application shows if the Network Element is in maintenance mode currently or not.
If it is True it means the Network Element is currently undergoing maintenance, If false it means maintenance might have been set for future or maintenance is already completed.

Users have access to disable the Maintenance mode or change the maintenance start and end dates at any point of time by clicking on the Manage checkbox available.
