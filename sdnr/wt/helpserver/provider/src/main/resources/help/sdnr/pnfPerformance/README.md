# Performance

Performance Monitoring values measured by the devices are necessary to analyze and optimize the network. Therefore the application automatically retrieves all historical performance values from the devices and stores them in a database. The client retrieves the values from the database and displays them in a graphical user interface.

## Performance history values

After selecting a connected PNF supporting ONF-TR-532 and a physical interface, the application collects the received and centralized stored performance values for this interface. The data gets displayed as a line chart to visualize the data in a given time period and a corresponding table. If the table gets filtered, the chart updates itself.
