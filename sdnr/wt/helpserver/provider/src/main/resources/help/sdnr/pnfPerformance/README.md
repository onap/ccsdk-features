# Performance

Performance Monitoring values measured by the devices are necessary to analyze and optimize the network. Therefore the application automatically retrieves all historical performance values from the devices and stores them in a database. The client part just retrieves the values from the database and displays them in graphical user interface.

## Performance history values

After selection of a connected PNF supporting ONF-TR-532 and an physical interface, the application collects the received and centralized stored performance values for this interface and displays them in table views.
