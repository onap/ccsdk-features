# Configuration & Persistency Service

This folder contains all files for 
[Configuration & Persistency Service](https://wiki.onap.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=81406119).

The code here is related to CPS POC, then it must be kept self contained in this cps folder to prevent any impact on 
current ccsdk components and to be ready to be moved in its own repo once CPS becomes a standalone project.
